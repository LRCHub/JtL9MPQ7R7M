We don't like the matadors
We just wanna see them fall
We will cheer the bull's success
Nothing more, nothing less

In this ring the bulls are king
We'll be here through thick and thin
We will cheer the bull's success
Nothing more, nothing less

With underdogs we stand
As long as there's a chance
As long as we are still breathing

Enter with your pride and sin
Exit in humility
We will cheer the bull's success
Nothing more, nothing less

In this ring are ruthless horns
Mightier than any sword
We will cheer the bull's success
Nothing more, nothing less

If you want blood
Come get your fill
The matador's is sure to spill
As long as we are still breathing

With underdogs we stand
As long as there's a chance
As long as we are still breathing

With underdogs we stand
(If you want blood)
(Come get your fill)
As long as there's a chance
(The matador's is sure to spill)
As long as we are still breathing
