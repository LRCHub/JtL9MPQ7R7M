[00:32.82] Come with it now!
[00:39.05] Come with it now!
[00:47.55] 
[00:44.40] The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
[00:46.89] Either drop the hits like de la O, or get the fuck off the commode
[00:50.18] With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
[00:53.62] Drop and don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
[01:17.12] 
[00:56.03] Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
[00:58.73] Of the power dons, that five sided Fist-a-gon
[01:02.01] The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
[01:05.39] The trigger's cold, empty your purse
[01:23.39] 
[01:07.71] Rally 'round the family
[01:10.84] With a pocket full of shells
[01:13.87] They rally 'round the family
[01:16.55] With a pocket full of shells
[01:30.55] 
[01:19.33] They rally 'round the family
[01:22.32] With a pocket full of shells
[01:24.78] They rally 'round the family
[01:27.99] With a pocket full of shells
[01:41.99] 
[01:30.70] Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
[01:34.23] Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
[01:36.96] I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library
[01:40.66] Line up to the mind cemetery now
[01:56.66] 
[01:42.10] What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
[01:45.62] They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
[01:48.48] While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
[01:50.69] Rally 'round the family, pocket full of shells
[02:13.69] 
[01:53.67] Rally 'round the family
[01:56.74] With a pocket full of shells
[01:59.63] They 'rally round the family
[02:02.34] With a pocket full of shells
[02:16.34] 
[02:05.48] They rally 'round the family
[02:08.06] With a pocket full of shells
[02:10.89] They rally 'round the family
[02:14.09] With a pocket full of shells
[02:28.09] 
[02:26.34] Bulls on parade
[02:31.76] Uh
